## About the Project
It's a very simple python script that:
1) gets the start time of the program
2) uses a variable for the amount of time between clicks
3) runs an infinite loop unless broken
4) checks if the current time is the set amount of time after the start time
5) if it is not then it continues, if it is then it clicks and sets the start time to the current time
6) if the "L" key is pressed at any time, it breaks the loop and stops the program.
